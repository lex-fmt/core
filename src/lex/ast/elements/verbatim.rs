//! Verbatim block element
//!
//!     A verbatim block embeds content that is not lex formatted. This can be any binary
//!     encoded data, such as images or videos or text in another formal language, most
//!     commonly programming language's code. Since the whole point of the element is to say:
//!     hands off, do not parse this, just preserve it, you'd think that it would be a simple
//!     element, but in reality this is by far the most complex element in Lex, and it warrants
//!     some explanation.
//!
//!     Note that a verbatim block can forgo content all together (i.e. binaries won't encode
//!     content).
//!
//! Structure
//!
//!     - subject: The lead item identifying what the verbatim block contains
//!     - children: VerbatimLine nodes containing the actual content (can be empty)
//!     - closing_data: The closing marker (format: `:: label params?`)
//!
//!     The subject introduces what the content is, and the closing data terminates the block.
//!     The data node carries the label/parameters describing the payload. As a convention
//!     though, if the content is to be interpreted by a tool, the label should be the name
//!     of the tool/language. While the lex software will not parse the content, it will
//!     preserve it exactly as it is, and can be used to format the content in editors and
//!     other tools.
//!
//! Syntax
//!
//!     <subject-line>
//!     <indent> <content> ... any number of content elements
//!     <dedent>  <data>
//!
//! Parsing Structure:
//!
//! | Element  | Prec. Blank | Head        | Blank    | Content  | Tail            |
//! |----------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
//! | Verbatim | Optional    | SubjectLine | Optional | Optional | dedent+DataLine |
//!
//! Parsing Verbatim Blocks
//!
//!     The first point is that, since it can hold non Lex content, its content can't be
//!     parsed. It can be lexed without prejudice, but not parsed. Not only would it be
//!     gibberish, but worse, in case it would trigger indent and dedent events, it would
//!     throw off the parsing and break the document.
//!
//!     This has two consequences: that verbatim parsing must come first, lest its content
//!     create havoc on the structure and also that identifying its end marker has to be very
//!     easy. That's the reason why it ends in a data node, which is the only form that is
//!     not common on regular text.
//!
//!     The verbatim parsing is the only stateful parsing in the pipeline. It matches a
//!     subject line, then either an indented container (in-flow) or flat lines
//!     (full-width/groups), and requires the closing annotation at the same indentation as
//!     the subject.
//!
//!     Verbatim blocks are tried first in the grammar pattern matching order, before any
//!     other elements. This ensures that their non-lex content doesn't interfere with the
//!     parsing of the rest of the document.
//!
//! Content and the Indentation Wall
//!
//!     Verbatim content can be pretty much anything, and that includes any space characters,
//!     which we must not interpret as indentation, nor discard, as it's content. The way to
//!     think about this is through the indentation wall.
//!
//! In-Flow Mode
//!
//!     In this mode, called In-flow Mode, the verbatim content is indented just like any
//!     other children content in Lex, +1 from their parent.
//!
//!     Verbatim content starts at the wall (the subject's indentation + 1 level), until the
//!     end of line. Whitespace characters should be preserved as content. Content cannot,
//!     however, start before the wall, lest we had no way to determine the end of the block.
//!
//!     This logic allows for a neat trick: that verbatim blocks do not need to quote any
//!     content. Even if a line looks like a data node, the fact that it's not in the same
//!     level as the subject means it's not the block's end marker.
//!
//!     Example:
//!         I'm A verbatim Block Subject:
//!             |<- this is the indentation wall, that is the subject's + 1 level up
//!             I'm the first content line
//!             But content can be indented however I please
//!     error ->| as long as it's past the wall
//!             :: text
//!
//! Full-Width Mode
//!
//!     At times, verbatim content is very wide, as in tables. In these cases, the various
//!     indentation levels in the Lex document can consume valuable space which would throw
//!     off the content making it either hard to read or truncated by some tools.
//!
//!     For these cases, the full-width mode allows the content to take (almost) all columns.
//!     In this mode, the wall is at user-facing column 2 (zero-based column 1), so content
//!     can hug the left margin without looking like a closing annotation.
//!
//!     Example:
//!   Here is the content.
//!   |<- this is the wall
//!
//!             :: lex
//!
//!     The block's mode is determined by the position of the first non-whitespace character
//!     of the first content line. If it's at user-facing column 2, it's a full-width mode
//!     block; otherwise it's in-flow.
//!
//!     The reason for column 2: column 1 would be indistinguishable from the subject's
//!     indentation, while a full indent would lose horizontal space. Column 2 preserves
//!     visual separation without looking like an error.
//!
//! Verbatim Groups
//!
//!     Verbatim blocks support multiple subject/content pairs sharing a single closing
//!     annotation. Use the `group()` iterator to access all pairs. See the spec for syntax
//!     and examples.
//!
//!     This special casing rule allows multiple subject + content groups with only 1 closing
//!     annotation marker.
