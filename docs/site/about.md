# About lex

lex is a plain text document format that combines the simplicity of plain text notes with the power of structured, parsable markup. It is designed to grow with your ideas, from initial sketches to polished documents, without requiring migration between tools or formats.

## Project Status

lex is currently under active development. The project is implementing the core "trifecta" of structural elements:

- Paragraphs
- Sessions (hierarchical sections)
- Lists

The format is being built incrementally with a focus on clear specifications, robust parsing, and comprehensive testing.

## Implementation

The reference implementation is written in Rust, providing:

- A complete parser with a five-phase pipeline
- Comprehensive test suite
- Support for the core structural elements
- Foundation for future extensions

## Repository
