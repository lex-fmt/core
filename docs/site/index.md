# Welcome to lex

lex is a plain text document format designed for the complete lifecycle of an idea. It scales from a fleeting thought to a finished thesis, from a line of code to a novel.

## Core Philosophy

lex is built on the principle that structure should be visible, intuitive, and effortless. By leveraging spatial layout (indentation) and a minimal set of unambiguous markers, the format becomes nearly invisible, allowing you to focus entirely on your ideas.

## Key Features

- **Simple at the Start**: As easy and immediate as a plain text note
- **Structured as it Grows**: Gains rich, hierarchical structure as ideas develop
- **Human-Readable**: Intuitively understandable in its source form without special training
- **Machine-Parsable**: Unambiguously structured for reliable programmatic processing
- **Future-Proof**: Built on Unicode text, independent of any company, software, or era

## The Core Elements (The Trifecta)

lex focuses on three fundamental structural elements:

- **Paragraphs**: Natural blocks of flowing text
- **Sessions**: Hierarchical sections that organize content
- **Lists**: Ordered and unordered sequences of items
