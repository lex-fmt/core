Grammare for txxt

    This document describes the formal grammar for the txxt language, outlining its syntax and structural rules.

    The grammar is defined using a combination of Backus-Naur Form (BNF) and descriptive text to provide clarity on the language constructs.

Terminology

    Span Elements:
        The smallest units of content in txxt, such as words, numbers, and punctuation, except for line breaks and indentation.
    Indentation: 
        Dedent and indent levels that define the hierarchical structure of the document.
    Line Elements:
        Complete lines of text, including their indentation and span elements.
    Containers: 
        A structural element that holds multiple child elements, defined by their indentation level. 
    Block Elements:
        Higher-level structures that can contain multiple lines or containers, such as paragraphs, lists and sessions.
    Document: 
        A structure composed of metadata about the document (which included non-content information) and the root node for the content.


1. Syntax Elements

    txxt strives to be syntax light, leveraging languages base syntax in addition to long held publishing conventions.  Hence, the nuimber of syntax elements is kept to a minimum.

    1.1 Explicit Syntax: 

        1.1.1 txxt-marker:

            The only explict syntax is the txxt-marker, defined by two consecutive colons (::). This marker is used to denote special constructs within the document, such as annotation.

    1.2 Implicit Syntax: 

        Both lists and sessions can be decorated with ordering markers,. but only lists can use the plain decoration ((dash)

        1.2.1 Sequence Markers: 

            - Plain style: dash (-) for  lists.
            - Ordered styles: 
                - Number: 1., 2., 3., ...
                - Letter: a., b., c., ...
                - Roman Numerals: I
                - Separators: dot (.), parenthesis ())

            Hence all of these are ordered sequence markers:
                1. First item
                2) Second item
                a) First item
                b. Second item
                I. First item
                II) Second item

        1.2.2  colons

            Colons (:) are used in pairs to denote special constructs, namely subjec lines.
        
    2. Line Elements: 

        Lines are the primary structural unit in txxt, consisting of span elements and their associated indentation level.

        1. Core Lines: 
            PlainDashed Line:
                A line that begins with a dash (-), indicating it may be part of a plain list.
            Ordered Line:
                A line that is part of an ordered sequence, denoted by its sequence marker.
            Subject Line:
                A line that begins and ends with a colon (:), indicating it is a subject line.
            Blank Line:
                A line that contains no visible characters, used to separate blocks of content.
            Text Line:
                A line that doesn t fit into any of the above categories, typically plain text.

        2. Line Types: 
            These are unions of core lines that define their role in the document structure.
            2.1 ListItem Line:
                A line that is either a PlainDashed Line or an Ordered Line, representing an item in a list.
            2.1 SessionTitle Line:
                A line that is a either a ordered line, a subject line or a text line, representing the title of a session.
            2.2 Any Line
                Any line that is not a Blank Line.

3. Elements: 

    1. Lists: 
        Lists are collections of ListItem Lines, two or more consecutive ListItem Lines 
        ListItems can mix different decorations styles (remember, they are not content, but formatting). The list style is defined by the style of the first list item

    2. Sessiosn: 

        Sessions contain a SessionTitle line, followed by at least one blank line, then at least one child content, which must be indented relative to the session title.

        <text-line>
       <blank-line>
      <indent> <any-line>...

    3. Paragraphs

        Paragraphs are one or more consecutive Any Line tokens.
        The trick is that paragraphs must be catch all, that is you don't match for paragraphs, you establish a paragraph by failing to match anything else.

        The reason for this is two fold: for starters, the general syntax of paragraps, which are any number of any lines, is a generic as possible, that is, it will match anything. Hence it has to happen last.

        Additionally, txxt is forgiving, and if it's not sure about and element form, it's a paragraph, precisely because paragraphs are pretty much anything.
