Annotations 

Introduction

	Annotations are a core element in txxt, but a metadata one. They provide , not only a way for authors and colaborators to register non content related information, but the right hooks for tooling to build on top of txxt, such as a commenting system before publishing.


	Core features:

	- Annotations have an optional labels [./labels.txxt] and parameters [./parameters.txxt]
	- Either label or parameters must be present (or both)
	- Annotations have optional content: inline text or block content (paragraphs/lists, but NOT sessions or nested annotations)

Syntax Forms:

	Marker form (no content):
		:: label ::
		:: label params ::

	Single-line form (inline text):
		:: label :: text content here
		:: label params :: text content here

	Block form (indented content - note TWO closing :: markers):
		:: label ::
		    indented paragraph or list
		::


Content

	Can be empty (marker form - the label itself carries meaning)
	Forms:
	- Inline text (single-line form)
	- Block content (paragraphs/lists, but NOT sessions or nested annotations)
	
Attachment
 
	Annotations are not part of the document per se, but metadata about part(s) of the txxt document. 
		hence annotations are attached to these elements at later stages. The rules for attaching annotations are: 
	- Previous element: annotations attach to the previous non blank line element in the same container.
	- Document level: when annotations are the first document elements , up to a blank line or any other element
	- Parent: if no such prev element exists, it's attached to it's parent element (the container in which it appears)
	
Parsing

	Annotations take precedence due to their distinct :: marker syntax. Invalid annotations gracefully degrade to paragraph parsing (e.g., missing closing markers).

	Multiple annotations can attach to the same node. They are stored as a list (not a map), so duplicate labels/params are allowed.



Examples:

:: note :: Important information
:: warning severity=high :: Check this carefully
:: debug :: (marker form, no content)
:: type=python :: (params-only, no label)
