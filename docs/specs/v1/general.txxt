The txxt language

    txxt is a lightweight plain text language designed to be a general idea format, that scales down to a single line up to full scientific publishing.

    txxt aims to deliver rich functionality, being more expressive than HTML or markdown, while remaining human readable and writable in its raw form, without the need for specialized software.

    The core philosophy of txxt is to prioritize human readability and writability, ensuring that documents remain accessible and easy to understand in their raw text form. In order to do this, txxt leverages long ago stabilized conventions from publishing, some of which are a few centuries old, and builds on them to create a modern, versatile format.

    Structure is denoted through indentation.

1. General

    txxt documents are utf-8 encoded plain text files with the file extension .txxt.

    Blank lines are any line that has zero or more non-visible characters (spaces, tabs) and no other content.

    The language makes no assumptions about column width, line length, or page size. These are considered presentation details that are outside the scope of the language.

    The core syntax for the language is multi-line. That is, the same line contents in different groupings can vary in meaning. 
    
    All lexer stages emit tokens paired with their byte-range location (`start..end`). Locations are mandatory for every token, including semantic tokens such as IndentLevel, DedentLevel, and BlankLine. Downstream tooling must preserve these spans.
     
2. Indentation
    
    An indentation step is represented by spaces in multiples of tab stops, which is 4 by default. Tabs are not recommended, but if used, count as 4 spaces.

    Since txxt aims to be flexible and forgiving, lines that have space remainders (as in 10 spaces, which converts to 2 tab stops with 2 spaces remaining) will be parsed with no error. Only two indentation level tokens will be generated, and the remaining whitespaces will be considered part of the text.

3. Elements

    1. Annotations

        Annotations are metadata elements that provide structured non-content information such as author comments, build tool directives, and semantic markers.

        Annotations are introduced by the :: marker and consist of an optional label, optional parameters (at least one of label or parameters must be present), and optional content.

        Three forms exist: marker form (:: label ::), single-line form (:: label :: content), and block form (:: label :: \n indented content \n ::).

        Note: The block form has two closing :: markers - one immediately after the label/parameters on the opening line, and a second bare :: marker after the indented content.

        Annotation content can include paragraphs and lists, but cannot contain sessions or nested annotations.

    2. Lists

        Lists are collections of at least two list items.

        List items can mix different decoration styles (remember, they are not content, but formatting). The list style is defined by the style of the first list item.

    3. Definitions

        Definitions consist of a subject line ending with a colon, immediately followed by indented content with no blank line between them.

        The subject line identifies what is being defined, while the indented content provides the definition or explanation.

        Definition content can include paragraphs and lists, but cannot contain sessions. This restriction ensures definitions remain focused explanatory units.

    4. Sessions

        Sessions contain a session title line, followed by at least one blank line, then at least one child content, which must be indented relative to the session title.

        Sessions can be arbitrarily nested, with the only requirement that they must have at least one item as content (aside from the title).

    5. Foreign Blocks

        Foreign blocks are used to embed non-txxt content within a document, such as source code, or to reference binary data. They are analogous to Markdown's fenced code blocks but use indentation for delimitation.

        A foreign block consists of a subject line, an optional block of raw/unparsed content, and a mandatory closing annotation.

        Two forms exist:
        - Block form (with text content): For embedding raw text like source code
        - Marker form (no content): For referencing external or binary data

        The "Indentation Wall" rule is critical: the subject line establishes the base indentation level, content (if present) must be indented at least one level deeper, and the closing annotation must be at the same indentation level as the subject.

    6. Paragraphs

        Paragraphs are one or more consecutive non-blank lines.

        The trick is that paragraphs are a catch-all. That is, you don't match for paragraphs; you establish a paragraph by failing to match anything else.

        The reason for this is twofold: for starters, the general syntax of paragraphs (any number of non-blank lines) is as generic as possible. That is, it will match anything. Hence it has to happen last.

        Additionally, txxt is forgiving, and if it's not sure about an element form, it's a paragraph, precisely because paragraphs are pretty much anything.
